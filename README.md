# Hey there! 👋

**Hi, my name is Spencer** and I like to attempt to solve problems with code, neural networks, and too much Tailwind CSS. Still figuring most of it out as I go.

Currently working on:
- 🔧 Building web applications and experimenting with new frameworks
- 🤖 Machine learning projects (with varying degrees of success)
- 🎨 Making interfaces that hopefully don't hurt anyone's eyes
- 📚 Learning algorithms and pretending I knew them all along

## 🚀 What I Work On

**Web Applications**
- Full-stack applications using React, Node.js, and various databases
- Spinning entire web applications from the ground up, designing it's systems, optimizing to scale, deploying them, then proceeding to scale to zero users.
- Trying to one day make user experiences that don't make people want to punch their computers
- Do TDD for the first two features, get frustrated, then do production based testing

**Machine Learning Experiments** 
- Data analysis and predictive modeling with Python
- Creating neural networks from scratch
- Trying LLM integrations within my web applications
- Computer vision projects
- Natural language processing attempts
- Working with datasets and hoping the patterns I find actually mean something

**Mobile & Desktop**
- Cross-platform applications with React Native and Electron. Going to try Tauri soon (I don't like Electron).
